My goal is to learn the basics and climb the stairs. It is also to be able to do all these software coding successfully.I also contribute to the work done in the company where I did my internship. Also, this is very good for me in learning software languages. One of the projects we are working on is [yedioyun.com](https://www.yedioyun.com/) website.The site we are working on operates in the game industry. They use the software we made. I hope I take part in many projects like this and I can improve myself.I will work for this without giving up. Because I love this job.
As time progresses, I will continue to share new projects and experiences from here.

Best Regard.
